## Syntax testing and others

## Challenge

- Create a new array of names.
- Write a new function that checks if a name is in your array. This function should take a name as a parameter and return a boolean.
- Use this function to check if various names are in your array and log the results.

### Challenge

Your task is to create a function named processInput that accepts a parameter of a union type string | number. The function should behave as follows:

- If the input is of type number, the function should multiply the number by 2 and log the result to the console.
- If the input is of type string, the function should convert the string to uppercase and log the result to the console.

## Challenge

Your task is to create a function named processData that accepts two parameters:

- The first parameter, input, should be a union type that can be either a string or a number.
- The second parameter, config, should be an object with a reverse property of type boolean, by default it "reverse" should be false

The function should behave as follows:

- If input is of type number, the function should return the square of the number.
- If input is of type string, the function should return the string in uppercase.
- If the reverse property on the config object is true, and input is a string, the function should return the reversed string in uppercase.

## Challenge

- Define the Employee type: Create a type Employee with properties id (number), name (string), and department (string).

- Define the Manager type: Create a type Manager with properties id (number), name (string), and employees (an array of Employee).

- Create a Union Type: Define a type Staff that is a union of Employee and Manager.

- Create the printStaffDetails function: This function should accept a parameter of type Staff. Inside the function, use a type guard to check if the 'employees' property exists in the passed object. If it does, print a message indicating that the person is a manager and the number of employees they manage. If it doesn't, print a message indicating that the person is an employee and the department they belong to.

- Create Employee and Manager objects: Create two Employee objects. One named alice and second named steve. Also create a Manager object named bob who manages alice and steve.

- Test the function: Call the printStaffDetails function with alice and bob as arguments and verify the output.

## @ Challenge

- Start by defining an interface Computer using the interface keyword. This will serve as a blueprint for objects that will be of this type.
- Inside the interface, define the properties that the object should have. In this case, we have id, brand, ram, and storage.
- Use the readonly keyword before the id property to indicate that it cannot be changed once it's set.
- Use the ? after the storage property to indicate that this property is optional and may not exist on all objects of this type.
- Also inside the interface, define any methods that the object should have. In this case, we have upgradeRam, which is a function that takes a number and returns a number.
- Now that we have our interface, we can create an object that adheres to this interface. This object should have all the properties defined in the interface (except for optional ones, which are... optional), and the methods should be implemented.
- Finally, we can use our object. We can call its upgradeRam method to increase its RAM.

## Challenge - Part 1

- Define the Person interface Start by defining a Person interface with a name property of type string.
- Define the DogOwner interface Next, define a DogOwner interface that extends Person and adds a dogName property of type string.
- Define the Manager interface Then, define a Manager interface that extends Person and adds two methods: managePeople and delegateTasks. Both methods should have a return type of void.
- Define the getEmployee function Now, define a function called getEmployee that returns a Person, DogOwner, or Manager. Inside this function, generate a random number and use it to decide which type of object to return. If the number is less than 0.33, return a Person. If it's less than 0.66, return a DogOwner. Otherwise, return a Manager.
- Finally, create a variable called employee that can be a Person, DogOwner, or Manager, and assign it the return value of getEmployee. Then, log employee to the console.

## Challenge - Part 2

A type predicate in TypeScript is a special kind of return type for a function that not only returns a boolean, but also asserts that the argument is of a specific type if the function returns true. It's typically used in user-defined type guard functions to narrow down the type of a variable within a certain scope. The syntax is arg is Type, where arg is the function argument and Type is the type you're checking for.

- Define the isManager function Define a function called isManager that takes an object of type Person | DogOwner | Manager and returns a boolean. This function should check if the managePeople method exists on the object, and return true if it does and false if it doesn't. The return type of this function should be a type predicate: obj is Manager.
- Run your code to see if it works as expected. If employee is a Manager, you should see the output of the delegateTasks method in the console. If employee is a Person or DogOwner, there should be no output.

## Challenge

- Define an enum named UserRole with members Admin, Manager, and Employee.
- Define a type alias named User with properties id (number), name (string), role (UserRole), and contact (a tuple with two elements: email as string and phone as string).
- Define a function named createUser that takes a User object as its parameter and returns a User object.
- Call the createUser function with an object that matches the User type, store the result in a variable, and log the variable to the console.

## Challenge - "typeof" guard

- starter code

```ts
type ValueType = string | number | boolean;

let value: ValueType;
const random = Math.random();
value = random < 0.33 ? "Hello" : random < 0.66 ? 123.456 : true;
```

- Define the function checkValue that takes one parameter value of type ValueType.
- Inside the function, use an if statement to check if value is of type string. If it is, log value converted to lowercase and then return from the function.
- If value is not a string, use another if statement to check if value is of type number. If it is, log value formatted to two decimal places and then return from the function.
- If value is neither a string nor a number, it must be a boolean. Log the string "boolean: " followed by the boolean value.
- Finally, call the checkValue function with value as the argument.

## Challenge - Equality Narrowing

In TypeScript, equality narrowing is a form of type narrowing that occurs when you use equality checks like === or !== in your code

- starter code

```ts
type Dog = { type: "dog"; name: string; bark: () => void };
type Cat = { type: "cat"; name: string; meow: () => void };
type Animal = Dog | Cat;
```

- Define a function named makeSound that takes one parameter animal of type Animal.
- Inside the function, use an if statement to check if animal.type is 'dog'.
- If animal.type is 'dog', TypeScript knows that animal is a Dog in this block. In this case, call the bark method of animal.
- If animal.type is not 'dog', TypeScript knows that animal is a Cat in the else block. In this case, call the meow method of animal.
- Now you can call the makeSound function with an Animal as the argument. The function will call the appropriate method (bark or meow) depending on the type of the animal.

## Challenge - Type Predicate

A type predicate is a function whose return type is a special kind of type that can be used to narrow down types within conditional blocks.

- starter code

```ts
type Student = {
  name: string;
  study: () => void;
};

type User = {
  name: string;
  login: () => void;
};

type Person = Student | User;

const randomPerson = (): Person => {
  return Math.random() > 0.5
    ? { name: "john", study: () => console.log("Studying") }
    : { name: "mary", login: () => console.log("Logging in") };
};

const person = randomPerson();
```

- Define the Person and Student types. Student should have a study method and Person should have a login method.
- Create a function named isStudent that takes a parameter person of type Person.
- In the function signature, specify a return type that is a type predicate: person is Student.
- In the function body, use a type assertion to treat person as a Student, and check if the study - method is not undefined. This will return true if person is a Student, and false otherwise.
- Use the isStudent function in an if statement with person as the argument.
- In the if block (where isStudent(person) is true), call the study method on person. TypeScript knows that person is a Student in this block, so this is safe.
- In the else block (where isStudent(person) is false), call the login method on person. This is safe because if person is not a Student, it must be a Person, and all Person objects have a login method.

## Challenge - Discriminated Unions and exhaustive check using the never type

A discriminated union in TypeScript is a type that can be one of several different types, each identified by a unique literal property (the discriminator), allowing for type-safe handling of each possible variant.

- starter code

```ts
type IncrementAction = {
  amount: number;
  timestamp: number;
  user: string;
};

type DecrementAction = {
  amount: number;
  timestamp: number;
  user: string;
};

type Action = IncrementAction | DecrementAction;

```
````

- Write a reducer function that takes the current state and an action, and returns the new state. The reducer function should use a switch statement or if-else chain on the type property of the action to handle each action type differently.

- In the default case of the switch statement or the final else clause, perform an exhaustive check by assigning the action to a variable of type never. If there are any action types that haven't been handled, TypeScript will give a compile error.

- Implement the logic for each action type in the reducer function. This typically involves returning a new state based on the current state and the properties of the action.

- Use the reducer function in your application to handle actions and update the state.
